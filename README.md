# Tokyo Tesla 3D Drive

An immersive browser-based 3D driving simulation featuring a Tesla Model S autonomously driving through Tokyo's Shuto Expressway C1 loop. Experience the thrill of high-speed driving through a neon-lit Tokyo night with Gran Turismo-style driver's view perspective.

## Features

- **Autonomous Driving**: Sit back and enjoy the ride - the Tesla drives itself
- **Driver's View**: Immersive first-person perspective from the driver's seat
- **Shuto Expressway C1**: Loop around Tokyo's famous circular expressway
- **Night Mode**: Experience Tokyo's stunning nighttime cityscape
- **Speed Effects**: Motion blur, particles, and dynamic camera movements for enhanced immersion
- **Real-time 3D**: Powered by Three.js for smooth 60 FPS performance
- **Simple Controls**: Just press START and enjoy the endless drive

## Technology Stack

- **Three.js**: WebGL-based 3D rendering
- **Pure JavaScript**: No frameworks required
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Hardware-accelerated rendering
- **Post-Processing**: Bloom effects for enhanced visuals

## Quick Start

### Running Locally

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd race
```

2. Serve the files using any HTTP server:

**Using Python 3:**
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

**Using Node.js (http-server):**
```bash
npx http-server -p 8000
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

4. Click the **START** button and enjoy the ride!

## Controls

- **START Button**: Begin the driving simulation
- **ESC Key** or **Stop Button**: Return to start screen
- **No driving controls**: The vehicle is fully autonomous

## Browser Compatibility

Recommended browsers:
- Chrome 90+ (recommended)
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

Requires WebGL support and modern JavaScript features.

## Performance

The application is optimized for:
- **Target**: 60 FPS on modern hardware
- **Resolution**: Adaptive based on device
- **GPU**: Utilizes hardware acceleration
- **Mobile**: Responsive design (desktop recommended for best experience)
